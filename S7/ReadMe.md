We did all the required things:

1. We started with 400K odd parameters with 1 dilated conv in parallel and two depth separated conv. Got 80+ accuracy in 5th Epoch [link](https://github.com/GadirajuSanjayvarma/EVA4/blob/master/S7/EVA04_S7_.ipynb)
2)We also used different python files to import  required functions.
3)We also tried to save the model in drive for future purposes.
4)We used RandomRotation() and horizontal flip() in order to get best test accuracy.
5)we can also reduce the no of parameters to get best accuracy.
6)we used dilated and depthwise seperable convolutions in our model.
7)our model final receptive field reaches around 70
